## Description:
- The DAD is a [[NPS WIKI#310 MHz|310 MHz]] Receiver and Decoder.
- This circuit has no microcontroller and simply monitors a physical location for the desired RF.
- This circuit takes a carrier wave, filters it, and converts it to an [[NPS WIKI#*IF *|Intermediate Frequency]].
- The signal is then passed down an Ethernet cable to a [[DCM]].
## Circuit Design:

## Code:
- There is no code for the DAD.
